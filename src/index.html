            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Abubeker Juhar, a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at AAiT. I'm passionate about creating impactful software that brings value to businesses and users alike.</p>
            <p>With a solid foundation in development, I'm proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, and other backend technologies. My goal is to design and build practical, business-focused software solutions that meet real-world needs.</p>
            <p>I've had the opportunity to work on several development projects, including collaborations with INSA, where I applied my skills to real-life applications. Additionally, I've developed some personal projects to sharpen my skills and explore innovative solutions.</p>
